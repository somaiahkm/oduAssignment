Question 3
1 & 2. Exploratory data analysis and justification
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selected Features:
-> 'seller'
-> 'yearOfRegistration'
-> 'gearbox'
-> 'powerPS'
-> 'kilometer'
-> 'fuelType'
-> 'brand'
-> 'notRepair'

And obviously the label, 'price'.


-> The 'seller' feature can be considered as a feature. When translated, there are only two possible 
values to this feature. Private and business. They are features which can weigh in on the model 
because private sellers would want more money for the cars as they are not a huge organisation.
But corporate sellers who sell cars as business would have margin to lower their price to increase
their popularity, to establish themselves as the most popoular seller, they might sell a lot of cars
for a way less profit margin than a private seller.

-> 'price' must obviously be considered while training the model as this is the label for the machine 
learning we would later build.

-> 'yearOfRegistration' feature is one of the most important features. Because it has a direct impact on 
the price of the car, the usual trend is, the older the car the lesser the money it will be sold for. 
The newer the car, the higher will be the price. A positive value can be assigned to this parameter, because,
higher the year, higher the price. 

And there are a few corrupt data, like for 'yearOfRegistration' there are values like 9999 and 1000. The whole row 
can be eliminated so that we can get rid of the corrupt values.

-> 'fuelType' can also be considered as a valid feature. As diesel engines lasts longer than petrol engines. We select features
when each feature has a different incfluence on the label. After training me might find out that a diesel engine parameter might give a
higher price to the car.

-> 'powerPS' is an obvious feauture as the power of the engine will be directly propotional to the price it will be sold for.

-> 'kilometer' can be used as a feature, as more the car has run, the less will be the power output capability of the engine 
and less will be the reliability of the car, therefore we can assign a strong negative value to this parameter. 

-> 'gearbox' can also be considered as a valid feature as manual gear boxes last longer than automatic gear boxes. Manual gearboxes 
are less prone to failure. The original cost of automatic gearboxes are expensive, but as this is cars being resold, they would have run 
a sufficient amount of kilometers where automatic gear boxes are more prone to failure over time. 

-> 'brand' can be considered as certain brands are just luxury car manufactures, and their price would be much higher compared to the brands
that make cars for all economical sections of the society. 
Brands like Mercedes, BMW are luxury car brands which will have a high cost.

-> 'notRepaired' can be considered as a feature, because repairs related to the engine or to the main functional parts of the car might have an impact
on the label. 

-> 'noOfPictures' can be ignored as all the cars have the same value for this column.

-> 'name' can be ignored as it nowhere impacts the  price of the car. 

-> 'postalCose' can be ignored as it does not determine nor influence the price the car in any way.

-> 'offerType' can be ignored as it will not influence the price heavily. 

-> 'abtest' I have not understood the meaning of the title, and the values it holds, that's why I have not considered it. 

-> 'vehicleType' can be ignored as it has a lot of missing values. 

-> 'monthOfRegistration' will not have an influence on determining the price of the car, that's why it has been ignored. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Challenges 
-> The main challenge was just trying to understand what the title and the values meant in english. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Model
-> As we are predicting a quantity, it's clear that we should use a regression model.
-> We have more than 3,00,000 elements of data, so we can choose a model which performs well with a fairly decent amount of data. 
-> Out of 8 features that we have selected, almost all of them are important, ofcourse some are more important than the others, like 'yearOfRegistration' and 'kilometers'. 
-> For the above reason we can use 'Ridge Regression' as almost all the features we have selected are important.
